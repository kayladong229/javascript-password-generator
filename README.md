# javascript-password-generator
Completed homework for the Module 3 Challenge. The purpose was to build a password generating process on a website using JavaScript that allowed visitors to pick a password length of their choice between 8 and 128 characters along with the option to include or exclude different types of characters (lowercase letters, special characters, etc.).
